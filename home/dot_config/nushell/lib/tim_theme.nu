# Colors are defined as records with the following three optional fields:
# - fg: foreground color
# - bg: background color
# - attr: attributes (e.g., bold, underline, etc.)
#
# Example: { fg: "#aa0000", bg: "#444444", attr: b }
#
# Attributes can be:
# - l: blink
# - b: bold
# - d: dimmed
# - h: hidden
# - i: italic
# - s: strikethrough
# - u: underline
# - n: no attributes (reset)
# (defaults to no attributes if not specified)
#
# We can access the tailwind color palette using the `tw` function (takes color 
# name and shade as arguments) and the gruvbox color palette using the `gruvbox`
# function (takes color name as argument).

    # shape_*: Applies syntax highlighting based on the "shape" (inferred or declared type) of an
    # element on the commandline. Nushell's parser can identify shapes based on many criteria, often
    # as the commandline is being typed.

    # an argument which has been declared as a string, and other parsed strings.

    # shape_string_interpolation: A single-or-double-quoted string interpolation. This style

    # shape_garbage: When an argument is of the wrong type or cannot otherwise be parsed.

    # shape_matching_brackets: When the cursor is positioned on an opening or closing bracket (e.g,

    # shape_external_resolved: Requires "highlight_resolved_externals" (above) to be enabled.

    shape_flag: { fg: (tw orange 200), attr: i }

    # color.config.<type>
    # *Values* of a particular *type* can be styled differently than the *shape*.
    # Note that the style is applied only when this type is displayed in *structured* data (list,
    # record, or table). It is not currently applied to basic raw values.
    #
    # Note that some types are rarely or never seen in a context in which styling would be applied.
    # For example, a cell-path *value* is unlikely to (but can) appear in a list, record, or table.
    #
    # Tip: In addition to the styles above (fg, bg, attr), types typically accept a closure which can
    # dynamically change the style based on the *value*. For instance, the themes in the nu_scripts
    # repository will style filesizes difference in an `ls` (or other table) differently depending on
    # their magnitude.
