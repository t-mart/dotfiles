[include]
  ; Include another file, it it exists. If it does not exist, git fortunately
  ; does not complain. Tested on git version 2.37.1.
  ;
  ; We use this for "platform specific" configuration. Really, it's
  ; just based off of file existence, but that'll do. And, by the way, the
  ; builtin "includeif" mechanism is too limited because it only offers
  ; per-repo predicates.
  ;
  ; For now, we use this to set gpg.program on Windows, where the default
  ; does not work well (perhaps because windows executables have .exe
  ; suffixes). Other platforms do not need this setting.
  ;
  ; The format for this file should be like:
  ;
  ; [gpg]
  ;   program = C:/Users/tim/scoop/apps/gpg/current/bin/gpg.exe
  ;
  ; This file should _not_ be commited to the dotfile repository because, then,
  ; every dotfile installation would get it -- indeed, we have .gitignore-d it.
  ; Therefore, it must be manually (unfortunately) created when needed.
