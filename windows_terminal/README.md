# Windows Terminal Theme (ayu)

In `ayu_theme.json` is a [ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme) theme for Windows Terminal.

It should be merged into the `schemes` property of the Windows Terminal `settings.json` file.

I don't want to make a source-controlled dotfile for it because `settings.json`
contains a bunch of stuff that's specific to my machine (shells, fonts, WSL, etc).
