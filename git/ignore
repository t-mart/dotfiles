# This is my user-level .gitignore Only files that are specific to me should go
# in here.
#
# Litmus test: If an another developer were to work on this repo, would would
# they _also_ generate this file (that should be ignored)?
# - If yes, put it in the project .gitignore. It's an expected part
#   working on the project.
# - If no, put it here. It's something specific to my workflow.
#
# For example, things specific to my editor/workflow/etc belong here.
