# TODO

- [ ] review nushell. things have changed since i last configured it.

  - can use package manager to install plugins
  - autoload directory
  - fix broken path completion thing

- [ ] windows terminal settings (take out of `extra/` and make it a proper
      dotfile)

- [ ] Cascadia Mono font, jetbrains mono font, etc. make consistent for windows
      terminal and vscode-insiders.

- [ ] we frequently have to disruptively update vscode-insiders so that
      extensions work.

      vscode-insiders is updated at least once a day. to take an update, i need to go
      through the update process (which requires a restart of the app).

      extensions are updated automatically and are often not compatible with old
      versions of vscode-insiders.

      this sucks. maybe we should just use the stable version of vscode?

- [ ] add missing dotfiles:
      - [ ] irfanvivew
      - [ ] sharex
